19500	22480	Pretty good, pretty good, yeah.
27360	35680	Nothing crazy new, just done with school, well, done with the semester, so that's nice.
38660	44600	Nothing super crazy, just doing my engineering program and volunteering in a research lab
44600	47360	and whatnot, so yeah, yep.
53440	53460	Yes.
56200	56940	Yeah, mechanical engineering.
66040	66080	That's good.
66080	69680	When I first went to college, I started out as a computer science major, and I had a really
69680	74120	hard time figuring out what I wanted to do and what I was genuinely interested in.
74580	80800	I kind of got into psych, just, I don't know, I thought it was interesting, so it was something
80800	84100	to do, and I kind of hopped around a bit there with what I was going to do with that.
84100	87080	I was pre-med for a while, because I would...
87320	91700	I love science and whatnot, and I thought, hey, like, helping people and, you know, all
91700	93080	the science with that would be cool.
94920	96920	Figured med school, probably not it for me.
98040	104300	I thought of doing...going to physical therapy school, because I also really love working
104300	109720	out and just sports and playing sports and things like that, so yeah, but I felt like
109720	113660	there was just an itch there that that wouldn't scratch, and I wouldn't...like, I'd be okay
113660	117100	with it, but I wouldn't be, like, super happy with it going.
117100	123120	In the long run, because I love, like, building and creating things and just all that type
123120	129860	of stuff, so engineering seemed like a good fit, and mechanical is just so broad.
129860	141180	I could do just about anything with it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mm-hmm, yep.
147100	148660	Pretty good.
148660	154540	I don't know, I've always had a hard time making friends, but I made friends with some
154540	157740	grad students playing volleyball, so that's been fun.
157740	164120	They're all in the, like, biomedical engineering department for the most part, so it's fun
164120	167740	playing volleyball with them, and I've just met a lot of people through volleyball, so
167740	173520	yeah, but doing stuff with them, yeah, it's been good, it's been good.
177040	182160	Yeah, yeah, everything's fine there.
183220	187280	My parents live an hour away from here, so I can go back and visit fairly regularly,
187440	188580	so that's nice.
203900	207520	I mean, since coming to college and kind
207520	214800	of really in the last, say, two years, I've definitely become more confident.
214800	219600	I was very shy growing up, and I went to a small school.
220040	228580	My graduating class was 82 people, yeah, yeah, so, like, you know everyone, and I was definitely
228880	235340	different interest-wise than a lot of people there, because, like, I mean, music-wise,
235340	236920	everyone listened to either...
237040	243460	like, rap, hip-hop stuff, or country, it's like, you get two, you get two things, and
243460	248080	I really liked electronic music, like, EDM stuff, for one, and then just, I was super
248080	254480	into, like, I remember in middle school going to my grandparents' after school, because
254480	260560	my parents were still working, so I went there until my mom got off work, and I'd be watching,
260560	267580	like, astrophysics videos on YouTube, so, yeah, I was just a good bit different.
267580	272320	A good bit different from everyone else there, and never really fit in, and was just kind
272320	279100	of shy and quiet to begin with, so that didn't help that, but, you know, going to college,
279100	285320	a lot bigger here, it's way easier to find, like, your people, because, like, you have
285320	289720	options instead of, you know, 82 people to pick from, yeah.
296600	309460	I'd say easier, yeah, yeah, like, meeting people that are interested in similar things,
309460	317020	and kind of working towards things that I, like, respect and find interesting, as well
317020	323480	has been very nice, yeah, yeah, it's been very helpful, I think.
326600	340800	Um, well, the type of people I'm friends with now has definitely changed.
342020	346640	Growing up, again, since I lived in a really small town, I didn't have a huge choice of
346640	356840	friends, yeah, a lot of, a lot of drugs and stuff in my school, too, that was not exactly
356840	363720	my cup of tea growing up, um, yeah, just, everyone's, that I'm friends with is really
363720	369260	trying to do something with themselves, you know, my girlfriend is going to nursing school
369260	376460	here, and that's tied for the top public nursing school in the nation, so, like, that's pretty
376460	381060	cool, and then I have my grad student friends, they're all doing, like, really cool things.
382700	387160	Yeah, just, I just think I'm around better people.
387160	387560	I'm around better people, honestly.
388560	389580	Yeah.
393280	393520	Good, I like it.
394480	394500	Yeah.
394500	395060	Yeah.
407920	409060	I guess, what do you mean by that?
412740	415840	Like...
416500	426900	Yeah, I mean, I mean, where I work right now, because I, I work in an interior design store
426900	433920	part-time, just in their warehouse, just, you know, pay rent, and that's, it's different,
434000	438040	it's kind of different than what I have done previously for work, because I've done, I
438040	444080	worked for my dad doing construction over the summers for years, and I worked at a,
444500	446500	um, grocery store in my hometown.
446500	448160	When I was in high school.
449500	457040	So that's kind of similar, because I also worked for my uncle, and he, like, so, does,
457600	462140	runs a gutter supply business, so it's just a lot of warehouse-type stuff there, so I
462140	469660	do kind of do some of the same things, but it's also a little different, but my, my volunteer
469660	474140	research assistant position is completely different from anything I've done before,
474140	474780	which is...
475300	476060	I like.
476300	477180	I really like it.
477300	481520	It's definitely the type of things that I'm interested in, so, yeah.
482760	494140	Um, the lab that I'm in does a lot of stuff with the neural controls of metabolism and
494140	495760	feeding behavior, things like that.
496540	500260	They're in the Bowen Science Building, actually, just, you know, yeah.
502360	504580	Amazing.
505340	505840	Thank you.
506360	508060	Um, not those changes.
508060	528840	I mean, my transition to college was a little rough, because I did have a hard time finding,
529140	533040	like, my people, you know, making friends.
533100	535340	And also, just, I was very low on my education.
536200	536280	Mm-hmm.
536280	544920	lost in what I was doing, like, what I wanted to do, what I was, like, here for, so that was kind
544920	552500	of rough, but I got through it, and I'm here now, so I've, yeah, I guess I'm doing all right.
554060	561320	I don't know about, like, resources and stuff, but I don't know, what all have I used? I mean,
561320	568460	I went to, I used to go to counseling, like, therapy, went to student health there for a while.
569400	579160	That was helpful. What else? I mean, talking with a couple of my professors had been helpful,
579920	585480	and, I mean, I forget what year it was, but I took a behavioral neuroscience class,
585860	591080	and I went into the guy's office hours just to talk about what he worked on,
591080	596320	and things like that, and he offered to show me his lab, and I got to see a grad student doing,
597080	603080	like, operating on a lab rat with a stereotactic device, and that was just amazing to see.
604180	609380	Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't know about other, like, resources exactly, though.
620880	633160	Um, I mean, get my engineering degree. I'm not entirely set on where I'm going to go with that.
633160	638600	I might go to grad school. I might do something else. I'm really interested in,
639280	643160	I don't know, I'm interested in a lot of things, but I'm really interested in,
643160	647460	like, programming and learning about, like, AI type of stuff, things like that,
648280	651340	and just technology around that type of stuff.
651640	655420	But, yeah, I, I could go in a lot of different directions with that,
655420	659840	and just kind of see what time brings, I guess. Yeah.
663500	668280	I don't know. It's just really interesting, and I see a lot of potential with it.
669420	675300	Yeah, just, like, so much potential, and just learning about how it works, and things like that.
676120	679200	I don't know. I could, I just see a lot of use cases for it, I guess.
680880	694360	I'm not super sure. I, I could really go either way. It's just kind of just see what happens,
694360	698440	and kind of, yeah, where the winds take me, I guess.
709320	710620	I mean, I,
710880	715320	I'd really like to stay in contact with the friends that I have right now.
715320	717600	I don't know how well that'll work, because they're all,
718800	721760	none of them are originally from around here, really.
722000	730360	And, I mean, my one friend is originally from Morocco, lived in France for a while,
730360	733760	and grew up in the Caribbean, and then, like, my other two friends are each from,
734240	738160	one's from the West Coast, one's from the East Coast, so I don't, I don't know.
740400	740980	Yeah.
741680	747020	I am dating a girl, and that's going fairly well, so I'm hoping things work out there, and I,
747640	750120	you know, have a family someday, all that type of stuff.
750120	750540	So,
751180	752560	yeah.
753860	754340	Yeah.
766520	767180	Um,
769180	770260	I mean, I'm probably going to stick with
771180	771700	working with,
771700	774040	working out and weightlifting, and I also play volleyball pretty regularly.
774140	783420	And I don't see that changing anytime soon, so, yeah, yeah, those are the things.
783600	798680	I know I'm fairly smart, um, I'm, just my curiosity is definitely one of them.
798680	799880	I love learning about things.
801320	801440	Um,
806720	806740	uh,
807440	807500	so, you know,
807500	807960	all these, um,
807960	822860	I, it's, I'm
828660	829960	I'm not 100%.
829960	830020	Or, okay.
830020	830380	So, I think
830420	830700	I'm probably the first thing.
830700	830760	But, you know,
830760	831000	there's,
831040	831200	um,
831200	831920	What things am I good at?
834040	837340	Just finding bits of interesting information.
837360	839240	I'm fairly good at that.
845360	846500	I don't know.
846500	849980	When I get interested in something, I'm really good at, like, staying on it
849980	852620	and, like, diving in fairly deep on it.
852620	855120	So that's something I'm decent at.
855360	857400	Although my interest does shift quite a bit.
857400	859060	So that, yeah, I don't know.
860920	861720	Yeah.
863700	864500	Yeah.
872380	873260	Weaknesses.
873260	873380	Weaknesses.
880200	884060	Well, one of them is that my interests shift around a lot.
884060	887560	So it is kind of hard for me to just settle into a thing
887560	890680	and stay with it for, like, really long periods of time.
890680	894560	That's the, you know, earlier in college, switching around majors
894560	895940	and being like, oh, maybe I'll do this.
895940	896860	No, maybe I'll do this.
896860	897580	Maybe I'll do this.
899300	901240	That's one.
903900	907480	Being able to focus on things that I'm less interested in
907480	909800	is not a strength of mine.
909800	912040	Like, that's something that I really have to work at.
912040	914600	I don't find it super easy.
918100	918680	Yeah.
918680	918900	Yeah.
934960	936140	I don't know, honestly.
936840	944020	I mean, I have ADHD, so that's probably a significant part of it.
949680	950020	But I don't know.
950020	950220	It's...
950220	950860	It's...
950860	954900	I guess, like, I'm just interested in so many things
954900	956060	when I find a new thing.
956420	960340	Like, I tend to zero in on that thing for a while
960340	962420	just because it's, like, new and whatnot.
963360	965820	And I kind of guess that's why I get...
966460	969220	Just the new things kind of attract me to them.
969220	971200	So then I get, like, really interested in that for a while
971200	976040	and I kind of leave the other things
976040	978340	that I had been working on previously
978340	979440	or learning about previously.
980260	982640	So, like, I tend to go back to things,
982640	985140	but I do tend to flip around quite a bit.
985800	985820	Yeah.
995240	998180	Just consistency with people's habits,
998860	1000780	like, building routines.
1001860	1003320	I'm...
1003320	1004680	That's another weakness of mine,
1004680	1006040	is sticking to, like, a new routine,
1006040	1007420	those types of things.
1007720	1009980	I just get up at, you know, early.
1009980	1010640	I have to go to the gym,
1010640	1011720	in the morning before I have to work,
1011720	1012420	things like that.
1015000	1017680	That and just focus in general,
1017680	1019320	being able to sit down and do something
1019320	1020640	for an extended period of time
1020640	1022900	without getting super distracted
1022900	1023900	to go do something else.
1025780	1029820	Those are definitely two big things.
1030600	1032600	Consistency and focus, yeah.
1034220	1035740	Yeah, I think those are probably
1035740	1036600	the two biggest things.
1040220	1049960	I mean, with the secondary routines,
1050140	1053140	just trial and error and, like,
1053620	1054820	thinking about, like, okay,
1054820	1056340	why didn't this work out?
1056340	1057060	And how could I...
1057800	1061880	What could I do to increase the likelihood
1061880	1063060	of it working out in the future?
1063060	1065360	Just iterating on that, basically.
1066860	1069420	Focus, that's just practice,
1069620	1070500	doing things.
1070500	1071080	Like I said, I'm...
1072740	1075900	Like, just trying to push the amount of time
1075900	1076840	that I spend on something
1077900	1079900	just a little bit, like, each time.
1079900	1081640	You know, just extending that out over time,
1081640	1082260	trying to...
1082260	1082700	Yeah.
1082780	1083180	Yeah.
1084060	1085240	I think that makes sense.
1094480	1097160	Actually, in my engineering...
1097160	1099200	In one of my engineering classes that I had,
1100420	1100780	it was...
1100780	1103160	It was intro to engineering problem solving.
1103260	1105920	Our, like, final project for that class
1105920	1110900	was to design and build
1110900	1113260	a short little tower
1113260	1115520	out of popsicles and hot glue
1115520	1118740	and see how much force,
1118740	1120100	like, how strong it could be.
1120100	1122300	So we put it in, like, a hydraulic press
1122300	1123600	and it pressed down on it
1123600	1124960	with a force meter
1124960	1126280	so you could see how strong it is
1126280	1126820	before it cracked.
1127740	1130200	And that one...
1130220	1133580	I worked really hard on that
1133580	1135200	because I just thought the project was cool
1135200	1136280	and got really into it.
1137740	1139520	What was it that we had?
1139520	1142480	Like, 600...
1142740	1144440	A little over 600 kilograms
1144440	1146620	or something like that.
1146680	1147840	So, yeah.
1148060	1151160	We pretty much blew the rest of the class
1151160	1151900	out of the water.
1152220	1155500	And the way that it, like, failed,
1155500	1157400	I think it could have gone further.
1157400	1159240	And I asked the professor afterwards,
1159240	1160520	like, hey, can we just...
1160520	1161800	Can we, like, stick a book
1161800	1162940	or something on top of it
1162940	1163900	and let it press down
1163900	1164940	just to leave it a little more surface?
1164940	1165280	And I was like,
1165560	1167140	eh, I, like,
1167140	1168380	I still have to do this
1168380	1169140	with some other classes
1169140	1170220	and I don't know how much
1171300	1174420	the, like, what the force meter is rated for
1174420	1175920	because it was just, like,
1175920	1177360	a little S-shaped block of metal.
1177360	1177660	I was like,
1177660	1178760	I don't want to break it
1178760	1179980	before we go to the other classes.
1179980	1182300	So I took that as a win.
1182300	1183560	I took that as a win.
1186860	1187520	Good.
1187560	1187740	Good.
1188340	1189300	I felt...
1189300	1189620	Yeah.
1190220	1191260	It just felt good
1191260	1193160	that the work that I put into that
1193160	1194280	paid off so well.
1195700	1196180	Yeah.
1203200	1204980	I was just really attentive
1204980	1206180	to detail with that
1206180	1210880	and gave it some good thought
1210880	1212820	because we did two iterations
1212820	1214620	of our tower.
1214620	1215720	The first one that we did,
1218360	1220060	our platform on the top
1220060	1220740	just broke through.
1220740	1221720	And we also got to see
1221720	1222420	all the other groups,
1222420	1223540	how they built theirs
1223540	1224920	and what seemed to work better
1224920	1225640	and what didn't.
1225820	1227200	So then I just
1227200	1230960	took the design ideas from that
1230960	1232800	and put them into the second one.
1232800	1233480	And, yeah.
1234160	1235340	I think the
1235340	1238600	attention to detail
1238600	1239800	is a really big part of
1239800	1240420	why that,
1240460	1242180	why it worked as well as it didn't.
1243240	1245220	That and just previous experience
1245220	1245820	with, like,
1246040	1247480	simple construction stuff
1247480	1248180	with my dad
1248180	1249040	because, like I said,
1249040	1250060	I did that growing up.
1250060	1250580	So that helped.
1250580	1250760	So.
1254220	1254840	Yep.
1255040	1255300	Yeah.
1256600	1257180	Yeah.
1257180	1257240	Yeah.
1270200	1271740	Sounds good.
