For example, we were laughing at something people said at our family Christmas and he kept asking, ""what's so funny?!"" in a frustrated tone. He doesn't quite understand why people find things funny and is very adamant about people explaining what made them laugh, smile, etc. Especially if he perceives it to be related to making fun of him.","Solomon is such an incredible story teller. A couple of months ago he verbally made up a 3 chapter story (and it had an additional bonus chapter!). After he finished telling me the story (10-15 minutes of straight talking) he gave me a 10 question quiz that included true/false questions, multiple choice questions, fill in the blank questions, and inference questions. In case you're wondering- I got 50% on it, LOL! The other thing I love about Solomon is that he is so FUNNY. His laugh is literally the best sound I've heard in my entire life. He likes to make jokes (which aren't always funny) but his laughter makes up for it. He's also incredibly receptive to emotional conversations and does an excellent job with talking about his feelings after he's gotten upset.
